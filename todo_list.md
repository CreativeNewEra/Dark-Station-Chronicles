# Dark Station Chronicles - TODO List

## üî• HIGH PRIORITY (Complete First)

### 1. Game Save/Load System
- [x] **Backend**: Add save/load methods to `StoryManager` class
  - [x] Create `save_game()` method that serializes player state, current room, inventory to JSON
  - [x] Create `load_game()` method that restores state from JSON file
  - [x] Add error handling for corrupted save files
- [x] **API**: Add save/load endpoints to `main.py`
  - [x] `POST /game/save` - saves current game state
  - [x] `POST /game/load` - loads saved game state (Note: Implemented as POST for consistency with filename in body, GET could also work with query params)
  - [x] `GET /game/saves` - lists available save files
- [x] **Frontend**: Add save/load UI to GameInterface
  - [x] Add "Save Game" button to sidebar
  - [x] Add "Load Game" option in game menu (modal implemented)
  - [x] Show save confirmation/success messages

### 2. Error Handling & User Feedback
- [x] **Frontend**: Add React Error Boundary component
- [ ] **Backend**: Improve error responses with user-friendly messages
- [ ] **Frontend**: Add loading spinners and better visual feedback
- [ ] **Both**: Add input validation for commands

### 3. Basic Testing Suite
- [ ] **Backend**: Add pytest and test basic game functions
  - [ ] Test player movement between rooms
  - [ ] Test command processing
  - [ ] Test save/load functionality
- [ ] **Frontend**: Add React Testing Library for component tests
- [ ] **CI**: Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing

## üöÄ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next Phase)

### 4. Enhanced Game Mechanics
- [ ] **Inventory System**: 
  - [ ] Add items to rooms (`Room` class update)
  - [ ] Implement `pickup <item>` and `drop <item>` commands
  - [ ] Add item descriptions and interactions
- [ ] **Combat System**:
  - [ ] Create basic enemy encounters
  - [ ] Add health/energy consumption mechanics
  - [ ] Implement turn-based combat commands
- [ ] **Help System**:
  - [ ] Add `/help` command that lists available commands
  - [ ] Add context-sensitive help based on current room/situation

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] **Command Suggestions**: Add autocomplete/suggestions for common commands
- [ ] **Game History**: Allow scrolling through previous command history (up/down arrows)
- [ ] **Visual Polish**: Add animations, better transitions, sound effects
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Improve keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### 6. Game Content Expansion
- [ ] **More Rooms**: Add 5-10 additional rooms with unique descriptions
- [ ] **Story Branches**: Create multiple paths/endings based on character class
- [ ] **Interactive Objects**: Add computers, doors, machinery to examine/interact with
- [ ] **Character Progression**: Add XP gain and level-up mechanics

## üîß LOW PRIORITY (Polish & Optimization)

### 7. Performance & Advanced Features
- [ ] **AI Response Caching**: Cache responses for identical prompts
- [ ] **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates without page refresh
- [ ] **Multiple Save Slots**: Allow players to maintain multiple save files
- [ ] **Settings Panel**: Add options for AI model preference, text speed, etc.

### 8. Code Quality & Documentation
- [ ] **Code Documentation**: Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Improve TypeScript coverage, add runtime validation
- [ ] **Code Splitting**: Implement lazy loading for React components
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Add basic analytics/performance tracking

## üìã COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] Basic game structure with rooms and navigation
- [x] AI integration with Claude/Llama model switching
- [x] Character class selection system
- [x] React frontend with TypeScript
- [x] FastAPI backend with proper CORS
- [x] Docker configuration
- [x] Environment setup and configuration
- [x] **Game Save/Load System**: Backend `StoryManager` methods, API endpoints (`/game/save`, `/game/load`, `/game/saves`), and Frontend UI in `GameInterface` (save button, load modal, notifications).
- [x] **Frontend**: Added React Error Boundary component (`ErrorBoundary.tsx`) and wrapped main App component.

## üìù AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
1. **Pick ONE item from HIGH PRIORITY first**
2. **Complete it fully before moving to the next** (including tests if applicable)
3. **Update this TODO when done** - move completed items to the COMPLETED section
4. **Ask for clarification** if any requirement is unclear
5. **Follow existing code patterns** and maintain consistency
6. **Test your changes** with both AI models before marking complete

---

## üö® CRITICAL NOTES
- Always maintain backward compatibility
- Test with both Claude and Llama AI models
- Keep existing UI/UX patterns consistent
- Don't break current functionality when adding new features
- Update type definitions when adding new data structures
